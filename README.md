# keepTyping: The World's Most Pointless Code
Wanna watch a computer type like a drunk monkey until it accidentally writes your message?
Welcome to keepTyping! This is a fun little program that takes whatever you type and goes on a random character spree until it manages to recreate your exact input. Think of it like a monkey with a keyboard who somehow, someway, ends up typing out Shakespeare. But in this case, it's your input!

# How It Works
Let's say you input I like croissants. The function will start by generating random characters from the standard keyboard and check if it hits the jackpot with the first character, I. If not, it just keeps trying until it does. Once it matches I, it moves on to l, then i, and so on, until it eventually spells out I like croissants. Magic, right?

# FAQ
Why this?
>Because who doesn't love a bit of randomness in their life? Plus, it's kinda like watching a super patient robot guess your password.

Why did you even make this?
> Because I was bored and have too much time on my hands. Also, I wanted to see if we could make a computer behave like a particularly stubborn toddler (I'm not definitely not talking about my neighbour's kid).

How is this thing useful to humanity?
> Honestly, it's not. But it’s amusing, and sometimes we all need a little pointless fun.

Have you considered making something useful instead?
> Absolutely not! Where’s the fun in that?

Can I use this to crack passwords?
> You could... but you'd be better off trying to guess the lottery numbers. Seriously, don't do it.

Why does it take so long to match long strings?
> Because our little typing bot is a bit of a slowpoke and loves to take its sweet time. Patience is a virtue, right?

Can I make it faster?
> Sure, if you give it a turbo boost and a cup of coffee. Or maybe tweak the code a bit. But where’s the fun in that?

Can I eat this code?
> I strongly advise against it. It probably tastes like regret.

**So, go ahead, waste your time. Give it a phrase and watch the magic (or lack thereof) unfold.**
Feel free to play around and watch the randomness unfold. Happy typing!
